# This project is for downloading projects off of keats.
This is a project intended to automatically download all videos in a course and store them locally. My aim has been merging [memst's](https://github.com/memst/keats_downloader) and [dylantjb's](https://github.com/dylantjb/keats_downloader) code into one single script easy to use script that any user can run without having to understand the code along with my edits.
Benefits include:
- Being able to play back videos at speeds the Kaltura player doesn't allow you
- Being able to use subtitles as a semi-accurate transcript
- Being able to watch high-resolution video streams with no buffering
- Offline download for those with bad internet connections.

## Todo

- [ ] Convert variable names from camel case to snake case
- [ ] Add an auto-install script
- [ ] Improve setup experience
- [ ] Headless mode
- [ ] Use of other drivers
- [ ] Linux and Mac OSX support
- [ ] srt download option
- [ ] Auto-add ffmpeg to path 
- [ ] Add padding so files are in order and avoid overwriting of videos of the same file name.
- [ ] Checking of files that exist so that you don't need to find and search for the same links again.
- [x] Multithread the get video list function to improve speed(currently the biggest bottleneck in the code)

## Requirements
1. To install the python modules used by the project run the following in the directory.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Download the chrome selenium driver [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). Extract and place it in the main directory such that the directory looks like this. 

### **Make sure the selenium driver you get is the same version as the chrome browser you are using!!**

```
./selenium/chromedriver.exe
./selenium/chromedriver/
```

3. Download FFMpeg [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases). Copy the contents of the bin folder so that there are 3 files in the main directory.

```
./ffmpeg.exe
./ffplay.exe
./ffprobe.exe
```

## Basic usage
1. Edit  `courses.txt` file with the URLs to all the courses modules you want to download separated by a new line. Its contents should look something like this(+example for Keats):
```
https://[Moodle Website]/course/view.php?id=AAAAA
https://[Moodle Website]/course/view.php?id=BBBBB
https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=CCCCC
https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=DDDDD
```
2. Execute main.py and it should walk you through the steps.
